"""RV32I mini-assembler for Pineapple-TT, extracted from
tools/build_boot_rom.py's Asm class (same encoding, same finalize()
fixup logic) so it can be imported by other programs instead of only
existing as inline script code. Adds SRLI, which the boot ROM itself
never needed but this LCD driver does (extracting the MSB of a byte
for bit-banged SPI). JAL here is standard RISC-V semantics -- writes
its return address ONLY to the encoded rd (unlike AgilA8's core,
which hardwires JAL's link register to r7 regardless of rd -- no such
quirk here, JAL(0, label) is a genuinely side-effect-free plain jump).

Wraps every OP_IMM/OP_REG/branch/load/store/U-type instruction
rv32i_core.v's ALU and decode actually implement -- confirmed against
that file directly (its `alu_op` case statement and `branch_cond` case
statement), not assumed. Earlier versions of this assembler only
wrapped whichever handful of opcodes a given script happened to need
at the time (ADD/OR/AND/XOR, ADDI/ANDI/ORI/SLLI/SRLI, BEQ/BNE/BLT,
LW/LBU, SB/SW) -- SUB, the other register-register shifts (SLL/SRL/
SRA), both SLT variants (register and immediate), XORI, SRAI, the
other three branches (BGE/BLTU/BGEU), the other loads (LB/LH/LHU), SH,
and LUI/AUIPC were all sitting unused in the core the entire time. No
RTL work needed to add any of this -- the gap was purely that nobody
had written the Python encoder for opcodes nothing had needed yet.

class PagedAsm:
    """Builds a bank-switched flash image for mem.v's FLASH_PAGE
    mechanism: a program larger than one WINDOW_BYTES-sized chip-address
    window (44 bytes / 11 instructions by default), broken into pages,
    each occupying its own WINDOW_BYTES-sized slice of the flash image.
    Page N's bytes live at flash offset N*WINDOW_BYTES -- matching
    mem.v's `flash_page_base = flash_page * WINDOW_BYTES` exactly, so
    writing page number N into FLASH_PAGE (0xFC) makes the chip-address
    window (LOAD_BASE..LOAD_BASE+WINDOW_BYTES-1) show page N's bytes.

    Why a page can't just "fall off the end" into the next one: PC
    keeps incrementing through the FIXED chip-address window regardless
    of FLASH_PAGE -- switching pages only changes what's fetched from
    those SAME addresses going forward, it doesn't extend the window.
    So every page reserves its OWN last three words as:
      switch_offset-4: ADDI scratch,x0,next_page  (from the caller-
                        usable budget, not the reservation itself)
      switch_offset (WINDOW_BYTES-8): SW scratch,0(FLASH_PAGE)
      trampoline_offset (WINDOW_BYTES-4): JAL x0, LOAD_BASE
    which is why each page only has WINDOW_BYTES-12 bytes (8
    instructions at the default 44-byte window) of caller-usable code
    -- the ADDI that loads the page number eats into that budget too,
    it's not free alongside the SW+trampoline. Confirmed in practice
    that even 8 is tight: a fairly minimal 8-bit bit-bang SPI send loop
    needs ~10 instructions as a single routine, which does NOT fit in
    one page's budget. Splitting such a routine across pages isn't
    something this class does for you -- see this project's LCD driver
    notes for what that actually requires (a hand-written state machine
    passing progress in registers across an explicit switch, not a
    plain subroutine call, since a page switch can only ever land at
    LOAD_BASE of the target page, never at an arbitrary offset within
    it).

    The switch write happens EXACTLY WINDOW_BYTES-8 bytes into the
    page (not "wherever the switch call happens to be") because of the
    same same-cycle-redirect hazard documented in
    build_flash_handoff_stub.py: FLASH_PAGE takes effect for the very
    next fetch, which is always PC+4 relative to the SW that set it --
    so that next fetch must land on a word that's valid REGARDLESS of
    which page just became active, which only works if that word (the
    trampoline) is byte-identical in every single page. Fixing the
    switch's own position at WINDOW_BYTES-8 is what guarantees PC+4
    always equals WINDOW_BYTES-4 (the trampoline slot), every time.

    Page 0 is special: it's reached via build_flash_handoff_stub.py's
    RAM-resident handoff, not via another page's switch_to(), and that
    stub's own PC+4 lands on LOAD_BASE+4 -- flash byte 0 is never
    fetched by anything (see that file's "Why flash byte 0 is dead").
    This class inserts that dead NOP automatically for page 0 so the
    caller doesn't have to remember to.
