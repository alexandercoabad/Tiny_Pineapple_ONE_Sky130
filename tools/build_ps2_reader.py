PS/2 keyboard reader for Pineapple-TT -- Step 1 of the keyboard option
(see project notes): a bit-banged PS/2 receiver that decodes one
11-bit frame (start + 8 data bits + parity + stop) at a time and
reflects the last scancode byte on GPIO_OUT, forever. Meant to be
pre-programmed onto the external flash chip on the QSPI Pmod (CS0)
and reached via build_flash_handoff_stub.py's tiny bootloaded stub,
exactly like build_st7789_flash_image.py -- see that file and
mem.v's "Reprogrammability" / "Bank-switched flash execution" for the
handoff/paging mechanics this depends on.

Why this needs FLASH_PAGE at all (unlike a plain bootloaded program):
a real frame-sync state machine -- wait for a clock edge, sample data,
loop back and wait for the NEXT edge, eleven times per frame, forever
-- is comfortably bigger than the 44-byte/11-instruction on-chip RAM
window the normal bootloader targets. Same headroom problem the LCD
driver had, same fix.

Pin usage (GPIO_IN = ui_in, 0xF4; see mem.v):
  ui_in[3] = PS/2 CLOCK (keyboard-driven; idle high)
  ui_in[4] = PS/2 DATA  (keyboard-driven; idle high)
  ui_in[7:5], ui_in[2:0] are ignored by this program (ui_in[2:0] are
  only meaningful during the earlier bootload-over-GPIO phase that
  gets this program's handoff stub loaded in the first place; once
  running, this program never reads them for anything other than as
  don't-care bits ANDed away by CLOCK_MASK/DATA_MASK below).
GPIO_OUT (uo_out, 0xF0): overwritten with the last fully-received
  scancode byte every frame -- same "once a bootloaded program takes
  over GPIO_OUT it no longer reflects the demo counter" convention the
  LCD driver already established.

No interrupts on this core (see docs/info.md) -- this is a plain
polling loop, structured as one page per protocol PHASE rather than
one page per bit like the LCD driver's SEND_BYTE:

  page 0            : init (clear accumulator), -> START_LOW
  page 1  START_LOW : wait for CLOCK to go low (start bit) -> START_HIGH
  page 2  START_HIGH: wait for CLOCK to go high again        -> BIT0_LOW
  page 3  BIT0_LOW  : wait CLOCK low, sample DATA into bit 0  -> BIT0_HIGH
  page 4  BIT0_HIGH : wait CLOCK high                          -> BIT1_LOW
  ... (repeats for bits 1..7, 2 pages each) ...
  page 19 PARITY_LOW / 20 PARITY_HIGH : waited through, value ignored
  page 21 STOP_LOW   / 22 STOP_HIGH   : waited through, value ignored
  page 23 RESULT    : GPIO_OUT = accumulator; accumulator = 0; -> START_LOW

Each data-bit's LOW-phase page ORs a *compile-time-known* constant
(1<<n) into the accumulator register when DATA samples high --
exactly the same "every bit is a compile-time constant, no runtime
shift register needed" trick the LCD driver's per-bit pages use for
SEND_BYTE, just OR-ing into a fixed bit position on the way IN instead
of shifting a fixed byte out. This is also why bit position is fixed
per page rather than looping over a runtime bit-index: a loop would
need a per-iteration variable shift amount, which is exactly the extra
complexity this sidesteps.

Every phase gets its own low-and-high pair of pages (rather than e.g.
folding a "wait low, sample, wait high" sequence into one page) so
each page comfortably fits the 7-8 usable-instruction budget a 44-byte
window leaves after PagedAsm's switch+trampoline reservation -- see
asm_pineapple.py's PagedAsm docstring. The low-phase pages that DO
sample (the 8 data bits) are the tightest: LBU + AND(clock) + BNE-loop
+ AND(data) + BEQ + ORI + the switch's own ADDI = 7 words, still one
spare inside the 8-word non-page-0 budget.

Framing note: this program does not check the parity or stop bit's
VALUE, only that a clock edge occurred where each is expected -- good
enough to stay in sync with a well-behaved PS/2 device (this is Step
1, "prove the mechanism", not a fully spec-compliant PS/2 host with
parity-error/inhibit handling). It also never asserts CLOCK or DATA
itself (both are inputs here, and PS/2 is host-inhibit / device-clocks
in the common keyboard-to-host direction this only implements) -- so
there's no host-to-device command support, just passive listening.

Verified in test/tb_ps2_reader.v against a Verilog task that
bit-bangs real 11-bit PS/2 frames (start/8 data bits LSB-first/odd
parity/stop) onto ui_in[3]/ui_in[4], the same way a real keyboard
would, and checks GPIO_OUT lands on the exact scancode sent -- across
several distinct scancodes sent back-to-back, to prove the state
machine re-arms correctly rather than only working once.
